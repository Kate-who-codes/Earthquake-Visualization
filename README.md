# Basic Visualization



Data is taken from USGS which provides earthquake data in a number of different formats, updated every 5 minutes
The URL of JSON is used to pull in the data for our visualization





Import & Visualize the Data:

1.Create a map using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes for last month based on their longitude and latitude;

2.Create data markers that reflect the earthquake magnitutude;

3.Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger and darker in color;

4.Including popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked;

5.Creating a legend that provides context for a map data.
